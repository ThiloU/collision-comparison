"""
Generate benchmark cases to replicate the experimental setup used in the
paper which introduced Nesterov Accelerated GJK:
for a FIXED shape pair, sample many random relative poses for each of a
range of target separation distances dist(A1, A2) in [-0.1 m, 1 m]
to see how different algorithms perform on different distances.

Note: the "distance" field in the case files only stores the non-negative distance.
The actual signed distance is stored in the "target_distances.csv" file.
